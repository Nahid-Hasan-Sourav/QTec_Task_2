# Array Sorting and Search

This project solves the problem of searching for a target number in a sorted array or determining the index where it should be inserted.


## Solution
### I solve the problem using Javascript Programming Language

The solution uses a binary search algorithm to search for the target number in the sorted array. If the target is found, it returns its index. If the target is not found, it returns the index where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

## Algorithm

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Initialize two pointers for binary search: `left` and `right`.
3. Perform binary search to find the target or determine its insertion position.
4. If the target is found, return its index. Otherwise, return the index where the target should be inserted.
